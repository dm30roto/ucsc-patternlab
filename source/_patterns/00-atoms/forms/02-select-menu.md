title: Select Menu
---

Basic select menu. This should be used when there are more than 7 options but less than 15. If less than 7, consider radio buttons. If more than 15, consider using a text field, potentially with auto-complete.

Like other form inputs, a select menu should always have a label next to it (W3C standard). However, you should also have a meaningful label (not generic ones like “None” or “Please select”) inside the select menu that tells users what exactly they’re selecting. The label should clear and distinct in order to fully describe the group of options.

You should avoid having a default unless you believe a large portion of your user’s (maybe 90%) will select that value. Particularly if it’s a required field.
