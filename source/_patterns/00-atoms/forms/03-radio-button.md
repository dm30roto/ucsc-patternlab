title: Radio Button
---

Basic radio button. In case you have less than 7 options, if possible, use radio buttons rather than drop-down menus. Radio buttons have lower cognitive load because they make all options visible so that users can easily compare them. If there is only 2 options and the options are turning a single option on or off, consider using a checkbox. The exception for this can be a Wizard.

Options should be listed in a logical order, such as most likely to be selected to least, simplest operation to most complex, or least risk to most. Alphabetical ordering is not recommended since it is language dependent and not localizable.

Always offer a default selection. Also, always use labels as click targets to make it easier for the user to select the option.

Try to lay out your lists vertically. Only one choice per line is recommended.

Avoid nesting radio buttons with other radio buttons or checkboxes.
