title: Toggle
---

Basic toggle. The toggle switch represents a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off.

A checkbox should be a small square that has a checkmark or an X when selected.

Present lists vertically, with one choice per line.

Use positive and active wording for checkbox labels, so that it’s clear what will happen if the user turns on the checkbox. Avoid negations such as “Don’t send me more email,” which would mean that the user would have to check the box in order for something not to happen.
